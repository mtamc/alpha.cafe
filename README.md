Old school fansite for the manga **Yokohama Kaidashi Kikou**. Borrows elements from late-00s websites incl.:

- Compact design using small fonts and minimal empty space between elements.

- Narrow max width (relative to modern resolutions).

- Emphasis on copy over slogans, titles, and images.

This is both purposeful nostalgia and genuine personal preference. Modern webdesign is still used, e.g.:

- CSS3 properties such as box-shadow, border-radius, transition, and even flexbox.

- CSS functions (var(), calc(), rgba(), linear-gradient()...).

- Full responsiveness using media queries.

- SCSS.

- HTML5 with semantic elements.

A few additional guiding principles:

### Coding-wise
Simple HTML with emphasis on separation of concerns. Meaningless non-semantic markup (e.g. "wrapper" elements) must be employed as a last resort. HTML must, ideally, be fully understandable without comments.

Amply commented SCSS with the aim to be understood by third parties. Elements higher on the page are located higher in the code and properties are sorted alphabetically. Repetition must be minimized. Themability must be maximized.

### Writing-wise
Simple vocabulary and concise phrasing. Cutting out information is acceptable if the resulting prose has a higher "interesting information√∑text length" ratio. Thematic sections must follow crisp headings so users can easily find information relevant to them.
