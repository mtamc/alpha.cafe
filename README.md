Old school fansite for the manga **Yokohama Kaidashi Kikou**. 

### Borrows elements from late-00s websites:

- Compact design using small fonts and minimal empty space between elements.
- Narrow max width (relative to modern resolutions).
- Emphasis on copy over slogans, titles, and images.

This is both purposeful nostalgia and genuine personal preference. 

### Modern webdesign is still used, e.g.:

- CSS3 properties such as box-shadow, border-radius, transition, and even flexbox.
- CSS functions (var(), calc(), rgba(), linear-gradient()...)
- Fonts.
- Full responsiveness using media queries.
- Webm.
- SCSS.
- HTML5 with semantic elements.

A few additional principles I applied:

### Clean code
- Simple HTML with emphasis on separation of concerns.
- Meaningless non-semantic markup (e.g. "wrapper" elements) must be employed as a last resort. 
- HTML must, ideally, be fully understandable without comments.
- Amply commented SCSS with the aim to be understood by third parties.
- Elements higher on the page are located higher in the code.
- Properties are sorted alphabetically. 
- Repetition must be minimized. (DRY)
- Themability must be maximized.

### Appealing copy
- Simple vocabulary and concise phrasing.
- "Interesting information√∑text length" ratio is more important than comprehensiveness. 
- Thematic sections must follow crisp headings so users can easily find information relevant to them. 
- Emphasize key words and phrases(?)

### Loading times
- Optimizing loading times is crucial for user experience (and bounce rate).
- The total transfer size to load the home page is only **320KB** -- including images, fonts, stylesheets, thumbnails, everything except the animations' fullsize.
- Gifs have been transcoded to webm. Animated thumbnails total no larger than 175KB. Fullsize animations (loaded on demand only) total 360KB. 

### CSS full-size image viewer
- Figure thumbnails can be enlarged with a click. The full version will appear in the center of the screen above a black overlay. This can be closed by clicking anywhere.
  - This is achieved without JS by wrapping the image in a checkbox label. While initial testing showed no glaring accessibility issue, further tests are desirable.
- Before thumbnails are loaded, a nice CSS-only loading animation shows in their stead.
